## Abstract
Cryptocurrency prices exhibit extreme volatility and
are strongly influenced by investor attention spans, which can
be observed through social media platforms. The project aims
to examine the connection between this social media sentiment,
extracted from Twitter (X) and Reddit, and BTC pricing, to
identify if the former can forecast the latter. The project utilizes
a blend of time series model and machine learning regressors,
including VADER, time series modeling via SARIMAX/ARIMA,
and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Our analysis shows that the
connection between sentiment score and cryptocurrency pricing
is limited. It is not statistically significant over the long term,
with minor gains in significance over the short term.
